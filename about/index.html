<p>Adaptive images are the current hot topic in the Adaptive Design
and Responsive Web Design conversations. Why? Because no one likes any of the
solutions. New elements and attributes are being discussed as a solution for
what is, for most of us, a big headache.</p>

<p >We have foreground and background images. We have large displays
and small displays. We have regular resolution and high resolution displays. We
have good bandwidth and low bandwidth connections. We have portrait and
landscape orientations.</p>

<p>Some choose to &quot;waste bandwidth&quot; (and memory) by sending
high-resolution images to all devices. Others send regular resolution images to
all devices which look less crisp on high resolution displays. </p>

<p>What we really want to do is send the most appropriate size and resolution
image based on the browser and device making the request.</p>

<p>We've solved adaptive images when it comes to background images.
Media queries make it almost simple to send the right size and resolution
images based on the device pixel ratio, viewport size and even the orientation
of the screen. By using media queries with our background image styles, we can
mark up our code to ensure that only the images we will be using are downloaded
from the server. We can limit the downloads to the assets that are most
appropriate, saving bandwidth, memory and http requests. Unfortunately, there
has historically been no solution for foreground images. Until now.</p>

<h1>Proposed solutions with new technology</h1>

<p>With content images, it's a bit more difficult to have the browser
download and display only the appropriate foreground image. Most believe that
there is no mechanism for the '<code>&lt;img&gt;'</code> tag to download the right size and resolution image. <a
href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">Polyfills</a> have been
created. <a href="http://sencha.com/products.io">Services</a> have
been formed.</p>

<p>The '<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-picture-element/#the-picture-element">&lt;picture&gt;'</a> element, leveraging the semantics of the HTML5 '&lt;video&gt;' elements with
its support of media queries to swap in different source files was proposed:</p>

<pre>&lt;<b>picture</b> alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt; 
     &lt;source src=&quot;large.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width:1600px),
     (min-resolution: 136dpi) and (min-width:800px)&quot;&gt;
     &lt;source src=&quot;medium.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width:800px),
     (min-resolution: 136dpi) and (min-width:400px)&quot;&gt;
     &lt;source src=&quot;small.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- fallback --&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</pre>

<p>Another method, using a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/srcset/w3c-srcset/">srcset attribute</a> on
the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element
has also been proposed. The above would be written as:</p>

<pre>&lt;img
    alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;
    src=&quot;small.jpg&quot; 
    srcset=&quot;large.jpg 1600w, 
          large.jpg 800w 1.95x, 
          medium.jpg 800w, 
          medium.jpg 400w 1.95x&quot;&gt;</pre>

<h1>Possible Solutions with Existing Tech: SVG</h1>

<p>What many people don't realize is we already have the technology
to serve responsive images. We've had browser support for responsive images for
a long, long time! SVG has supported media queries for a long time, and <a
href="http://caniuse.com/#search=svg">browsers have supported SVG</a> for
... well, not quite a long time, but still. Most browsers support media queries
in SVG (<a
href="http://jeremie.patonnier.net/experiences/svg/media-queries/test.html">test
your browser</a>). When it comes to browsers that need responsive images, the
only browser in the mobile space that doesn't support SVG is old versions of
the Android browser. Android support for SVG began with Android 3.0.</p>

<p>We can leverage browser support for SVG and SVG support for both
media queries and raster images to create responsive images, using media
queries within SVG to serve up the right image.</p>

<p>When you mark up your HTML, you simply add a single call to an SVG
file.</p>

<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>Now isn't that code simple?</p>

<p>In our SVG file, using the <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> element, we include all the images that we may need to
serve, and include all the media queries.</p>

<p>While using &lt;image&gt; in our SVG, with @media queries used to
show and hide them, seemed like an obvious solution, display: none; on an
&lt;image&gt; in SVG, similar to &lt;img&gt; in HTML, does not prevent the
resource from being downloaded. If you <a
href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/local.svg">open the SVG above in your
browser</a> that uses &lt;image&gt; in your browser, when this file is loaded,
all 4 PNGs are retrieved from the server, making 4 additional http requests,
wasting bandwidth on files that will not be used, and wasting memory.</p>

<h2>Download single raster image</h2>

<p>We know from background image that it is indeed possible to get
the browser to only download needed images. In CSS we can do this with
background images. To prevent the SVG from downloading all the included images
we can use the CSS background images instead of foreground image in our SVG
file:</p>

<pre>&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 300 329&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMidYMid meet&quot;&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Clown Car Technique&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  svg {
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
  }
  @media screen and (max-width: 400px) {
    svg {
      background-image: url(images/small.png&quot;);
    }
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 700px) {
    svg {
       background-image: url(images/medium.png);
    }
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
    svg {
      background-image: url(images/big.png);
    }
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 1001px) {
    svg {
      background-image: url(images/huge.png);
    }
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>

<p>If you're familiar with media queries and CSS, most of the above
should make complete sense. The clown car technique uses the exact same @media
queries as you would use elsewhere in your adaptive site.</p>

<p>However, there is structure to our SVG. Unlike the <a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/local.svg">&lt;image&gt;
version</a>, we don't have any content
in our SVG. To preserve the aspect ratio of our graphics and ensure that is
scales uniformly, we include the <b >viewbox</b>
and <b >preserveAspectRatio</b> attributes.</p>

<p>The value of the viewBox attribute is a list of four
space or comma separated
numbers min-x, min-y, width and height. By defining
the width and the height of our viewbox we define the aspect ratio of the
image. The values we set for the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio">preserveAspectRatio</a> attribute
ensures that the aspect ratio defined in viewbox is preserved.</p>

<p>When you<a href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/bgonly.svg"> open
the SVG file with just the background images</a> defined, the raster image
will take up the entire viewport. The &lt;image&gt; version may look better
right now because it is maintaining it's aspect ratio, and the background-image
version is filling up the viewport. However, when you include the SVG as a separate
document pulled into your HTML, the aspect ratio is by default preserved.</p>

<p>This solves the http request issue. <a
href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/object/bgonly.svg">Open the SVG file
with just the background images</a> and look at the resources tab in your
developer tools and you'll see the SVG has only made 2 http requests rather
than 5. If you are on a large monitor, the browser will have downloaded
bgonly.svg (676 bytes) and huge.png.</p>

<p>Our first issue -- downloading all the different image file sizes,
even those that aren't needed -- has been resolved. This background-image
version only downloads the images required, thereby solving the multi-HTTP and
waste of bandwidth concerns. We still have the SVG file itself which requires
an http request. We'll solve that issue third.</p>

<h2>Content Security Issues</h2>

<p>In the Opera browser or Windows 9 or 10, open the <a
href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/imagetag/">SVG file</a> pulled in as an
&lt;img&gt;, then resize your browser window. Note that if you open in Firefox
or WebKit browser, you'll likely get no image. That is what this section is
about.</p>

<p>The code is simply: </p>

<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;../object/bgonly.svg&quot; alt=&quot;resizable&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>When you include the SVG in your HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> with a flexible
width, such as 70% of viewport, as you grow and shrink the container, the image
responds to the changes. </p>

<p>The &quot;width&quot; media query in the SVG is based on the
parent element in which the SVG is contained, not the viewport width. </p>

<p>As the window grows and shrinks the image display by the SVG
changes. In the SVG file, the images are defined as being 100% of the height
and width or the parent, which is this case is the above case, when we opened
the SVG directly, was the viewport. Now the container is the &lt;img&gt;.
Whatever width the image is, the SVG will grow or shrink to fit that size
maintaining the declared aspect ratio in the SVG, as long as height is not also
defined in a way that distorts the aspect ratio. </p>

<p>It's when we include the SVG in a flexible layout that the magic
happens. You'll note that the first time you resize the image, there may be
flickers of white as the browser requests the next required PNG -- this is it
doesn't automatically download all the asset it doesn't need.</p>

<p>These foreground images work perfectly in Opera and newer versions
of Internet Explorer (the versions you'll find on mobile devices). In Chrome
and Safari, if you open the SVG file first, caching it, the HTML file
containing the foreground SVG image works perfectly. </p>

<p>The content security blocking SVG from importing scripts and
images does make sense: to prevent cross domain scripting attacks you don't
want a file to be pulling in untrustworthy content. In the case of WebKit and
FireFox, SVG technology is supported. It is just being prevented from pulling
in external raster images. Firefox prevents it altogether. Safari and Chrome
work if the SVG is preloaded. I submitted a <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=234082">Chrome bug
report</a> to get the ban on importing raster image in SVG lifted. </p>

<p>In Firefox, the SVG on its own works. Firefox supports SVG and
supports SVG as background image. However, for security reasons, Firefox blocks
the importing of external raster images, even if those images are same domain.
The rationale is that if visitors are allowed to upload images, and the site
than displays those images and scripts as part of an SVG, that's a security
risk. I would argue that if the site uses user generated content that is not
secure, they're already doing it wrong.</p>

<p>For right now the simple line:</p>

<pre>&lt;img src=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt; </pre>

<p>is blocked in some browsers, and therefore isn't the full
solution.</p>

<p>Browsers all support SVG media queries. They all support SVG as
foreground or content images. They all support SVG as background images. The
support just isn't all the same because of browser security policies. All
browsers do support the &lt;object&gt; tag. That should come in handy.</p>

<p>Without making changes to the browser security policy, &lt;img&gt;
alone won't work. yet. We need to leverage the &lt;object&gt; tag.</p>



<h3>With &lt;object&gt; tag</h3>

<p>The <b> &lt;object&gt;</b> element allows an
external resource to be treated as an image. &lt;object&gt; can take care of
the browser security drawbacks we see with &lt;img&gt; that disallows the
importing of images or script into an &lt;img&gt; file. &lt;object&gt; allows
both.</p>

<p>The code isn't that much more complex:</p>

<pre>&lt;object data=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</pre>

<p>By default, the &lt;object&gt; will be as wide as the parent
element. However, similar to images, you can declare a width and height with
the width and height attributes or with the CSS width and height properties.
Simply declare just one value to ensure that the SVG maintains it's original
aspect ratio. </p>

<p>Because of the viewbox and preserveAspectRatio declarations in our
SVG file, the &lt;object&gt; will by default maintain the declared aspect
ratio. You can overwrite this with HTML or CSS attributes.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, the media queries in the SVG match the SVG's
container, not the viewport. The matched media queries in the SVG file will
reflect the parent of the &lt;object&gt; tag rather than the viewport.</p>

<p>If you take a look at an <a
href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/object/bgonly.html">SVG being pulled in
as the &lt;object&gt; data</a>, you'll see it works in all browsers that
support SVG.</p>

<p>We have a few drawbacks with this method: </p>

<p>&lt;object&gt; is supported in all browsers, even mobile browsers.
But this technique only works if the browser supports SVG too. So it doesn't
work in IE8 and earlier or Android 2.3 and earlier. Also, we have two http
requests to pull in the correct image: one for the svg file and one for the
raster image we want to show.</p>

<h3>Fallback f or IE</h3>

<p>What makes the use of &lt;object&gt; more interesting that
&lt;img&gt; is that &lt;object&gt; is a non-empty element. If you want, you can
include the &lt;img&gt; tag nested in the &lt;object&gt; for browsers that
don't support the data type. </p>

<p>For Internet Explorer &lt;=8 we include our medium size raster
image, since these are browsers that are usually displayed on monitors and
laptop screen at regular DPI:</p>

<pre>&lt;object data=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&quot;medium.png&quot; alt=&quot;responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, content nested within the &lt;object&gt; is
downloaded even when the object is rendered and the nested content is not
needed or rendered. The browsers that understand SVG will download the nested
foreground &lt;img&gt; but won't render it. This adds a download of the image
targeted for IE for all browsers, whether or not that raster image is the one
needed and used.</p>

<p>To handle this issue, we can use conditional comments for IE. </p>

<pre>&lt;object data=&quot;awesomefile.svg&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;medium.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fall back for IE&quot;&gt;
  &lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</pre>

<h2>Single HTTP request</h2>

<p>The method we've being using downloads both an SVG file and the
image file that the SVG calls, creating two http requests instead of one. If
you are concerned about this additional http requests, you can create a SVG
data URI instead of calling in an external SVG file.</p>

<pre>&lt;object data=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,&lt;svg viewBox='0 0 300 329' preserveAspectRatio='xMidYMid meet' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'&gt;&lt;title&gt;Clown Car Technique&lt;/title&gt;&lt;style&gt;svg{background-size:100% 100%;background-repeat:no-repeat;}@media screen and (max-width: 400px){svg{background-image:url(images/small.png);}}@media screen and (min-width: 401px) and (max-width:700px){svg{ background-image:url(images/medium.png);}}@media screen and (min-width: 701px) and (max-width:1000px){svg{background-image:url(images/big.png);}}@media screen and (min-width:1001px){svg{background-image:url(images/huge.png);}}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;images/medium.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fall back for IE&quot;&gt;
  &lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</pre>

<p>The above looks messy, but it's simply <code>data:image/svg+xml,</code> followed by the contents of the SVG file, minified. </p>

<p>The above works in all browsers that support SVG except Internet
Explorer. While this is frustrating, it's actually because Internet Explorer is
trying to follow the specifications to the letter. The specifications state
that the data URI must be escaped. To make all the browsers, including IE9 and
IE10 support the data URI we escape it:</p>

<pre>&lt;object data=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20329'%20preserveAspectRatio='xMidYMid%20meet'%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Ctitle%3EClown%20Car%20Technique%3C/title%3E%3Cstyle%3Esvg%7Bbackground-size:100%25%20100%25;background-repeat:no-repeat;%7D@media%20screen%20and%20(max-width:400px)%7Bsvg%7Bbackground-image:url(images/small.png);%7D%7D@media%20screen%20and%20(min-width:401px)%7Bsvg%7Bbackground-image:url(images/medium.png);%7D%7D@media%20screen%20and%20(min-width:701px)%7Bsvg%7Bbackground-image:url(images/big.png);%7D%7D@media%20screen%20and%20(min-width:1001px)%7Bsvg%7Bbackground-image:url(images/huge.png);%7D%7D%3C/style%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;
type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;images/medium.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fall back for IE&quot;&gt;
  &lt;![endif]--&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</pre>

<p>It's ugly markup, but it works! <a
href="http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/singlerequest.html">http://estelle.github.io/clowncar/singlerequest.html</a></p>

<p>Open the above link and open up the developer tools to check out the http requests. You'll note 2 http
requests: the html file and the png that the SVG pulls in. The status for the
SVG is "success" and the size over the network is 0, with the size at under 600
bytes.</p>

<h2>Landscape versus Portrait</h2>

<p>Generally content images
are either landscape or portrait: faces are portrait, groups of people,
products and sunsets are landscape. Some people have a huge issue with the
Clown Car Technique because the image doesn't change based on orientation
change. This isn't necessarily true. </p>

<p>The magic of CCT is that
the image rendered changes based on the size of the container. You can set your
landscape foreground image to 33% or 240px or whatever, and your portrait
object width to 25% or 180px or other. The object's size is determined in the
CSS of your HTML. The raster image served is based on the media queries that
match the object's size.</p>

<p>The aspect ratio remains
the same, but you can control which raster image is served by matching the
media queries in your HTML's CSS with your media queries in your SVG's CSS.</p>

<h2>Other Benefits</h2>

<p>Another asset of the &quot;Clown Car&quot; technique is that all
the logic remains in the SVG file. Similar to how we separate content from
presentation from behavior: this method enables us to also separate out images
-- all the logic is in the SVG image instead of polluting our CSS or HTML.</p>

<p>CCT will enable us to neatly organize our images, separating out our behavior from presentation from content from images. I can picture our file
structure being something similar to </p>

<pre> SVG
  Clowns
    Small.png
    Medium.png
    Large.png
  Cars
    Small.png
    Medium.png
    Large.png
    Cct.svg
  Techniques
    Small.png
    Medium.png
    Large.png
    Cct.svg
</pre>

<p>We'll be better able to
manage all of our assets. We'll also be able to have responsive foreground
images without littering our HTML with extra, unused code.</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>Above are the pros of the technique. The technique is still nascent, so I haven't figured out what all the issues are. And, when those issues are found, what the solutions are.  A few things that are still a concern include:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Page Layout</dt>
  <dd>According to John Wilkins, Clown Car technique requires full CSS layout before the image starts to load. I have not had a chance to compare loading for regular foreground images versus object versus object with SVG pulling in raster images, so can not comment on the impact of this issue yet.</dd>
  <dt>Android up to 2.3</dt>
  <dd>Android up to 2.3 does not support SVG. There are two possible solutions I have found that I have yet to flush out and test. The first is to use: <br>
<code>    &lt;!--[if !IE]> --><br>
    &lt;img src="images/small.png" alt="fallback"/><br>
&lt;!-- &lt;![endif]--></code><br>
in addition to the IE conditional comment. This will show the small png to all Android phones. Unforunately, this will download small.png for all browsers other than IE before IE9.<br/><br/>The other solution is for users of Modernizr: if you are already testing for everything else, you can include .no-svg in the &lt;html&gt; elements class, then target a webkit prefixed media query with a <code>.no-svg object[type*="svg"]</code> selector that adds dimension and background image to that object. Again, I have not yet tested this out.</dd>
<dt>Landscape versue Portrait</dt>
<dd>By relying on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio">preserveAspectRatio</a> within the SVG, the solution as described above will serve always serve 
images with a single aspect ratio. This attribute was added to ensure that as the width was made responsive and 
the height was left at <code>auto</code>, the 
height would automatically change to preserve the aspect ratio. This is not the only way of creating clown car technique SVGs. <br><br>
SVG media queries resolve to the container in which the SVG finds itself. We can construct our SVG to serve different 
images based on whether the container is landscape or portrait, and defined the container properties in the HTML's CSS, as briefly described above. 
I still have to play with different versions of the Clown Car Technique SVG to try various properties as well as media
queries that deal with orientation change and device pixel ratios.
</dd>
     
</dl>
<p>The Clown Car Technique is still a work in progress, but the more I play with it, the more viable a solution it seems to be.</p>
<h2>Why "Clown Car Technique"</h2>

<p>With naming help from <a href="http://christopherschmitt.com/">Christopher
Schmitt</a>, I called it the Clown Car technique since we are including many
large images (clowns) into a tiny single SVG image file (car).</p>

<p>The main question is: should we be content with &lt;object&gt;, or
should we get browser vendors to change their content security policy so we can
use &lt;img&gt;?</p>
